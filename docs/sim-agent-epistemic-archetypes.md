# A Taxonomy of Epistemic Archetypes: Attitudes Toward Knowledge Construction

## Theoretical Foundations

The attached document positions epistemological orientation not as a fixed trait but as an **interactional accomplishment embedded in social context, power relations, and developmental history** [^1]. It identifies four interlocking layers — interaction-level epistemics, the infrastructure of knowledge-making, structural/developmental orientations, and sociopolitical dynamics — each of which provides a lens for understanding how people relate to knowledge.

The taxonomy below translates these layers into five dimensions of epistemic attitude, each populated with recognizable archetypes. Like the discourse participant taxonomy, these are **dynamic positions**, not permanent personality types — a single individual may shift between archetypes across contexts, topics, or even turns of conversation.

## Dimension I: Developmental Epistemic Orientation

Drawing from **Perry's Scheme**, the **Reflective Judgment Model (King & Kitchener)**, and research on **personal epistemology**, this dimension captures where a participant falls along the well-documented developmental trajectory of how people understand the nature of knowledge itself [^1].

| Archetype | Developmental Stage | Core Belief | Discursive Markers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Dualist** | Pre-reflective / early Perry | Knowledge is **certain, binary, and received from authority**. Every question has a right answer; ambiguity signals ignorance. | "That's just wrong," "the facts are clear," appeals to singular authority, rejection of competing perspectives as error |
| **The Multiplist** | Quasi-reflective / mid-Perry | Knowledge is **inherently subjective**. Since certainty is impossible, all opinions are equally valid. Relativism as refuge. | "Everyone's entitled to their opinion," "that's true for you," refusal to evaluate competing claims, false equivalence |
| **The Evaluativist** | Reflective / late Perry | Knowledge is **constructed but not arbitrary** — some claims are better warranted than others. Evidence, method, and argument matter. | "The evidence suggests," qualification with reasoning, willingness to compare frameworks, metalinguistic evaluation of argument quality |
| **The Meta-Epistemologist** | Post-reflective / philosophical | Treats **epistemology itself as an object of inquiry**. Interested in the conditions under which knowledge claims become possible. | "What would count as evidence here?", "that depends on your framework for justification," explicit discussion of epistemic norms |

## Dimension II: Epistemic Stance in Interaction

Drawn from **Conversation Analysis (CA) epistemics**, this dimension captures how participants position themselves relative to knowledge **in real-time talk** — their displayed **epistemic stance** (how much they claim to know) versus their **epistemic status** (their socially recognized knowledge position) [^1].

| Archetype | Stance/Status Configuration | Description | Discursive Markers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Knower (K+)** | High stance, high status | Claims knowledge and is recognized as entitled to do so. The default expert in their domain. | Declarative assertions, first-position assessments, minimal hedging, evidentials of direct experience (*"I saw," "In my practice"*) |
| **The Overclaimer** | High stance, low status | Claims more knowledge than others grant them. Creates interactional friction when epistemic status is contested. | Unhedged assertions in domains where others hold expertise, resistance to correction, upgrading assessments beyond entitlement |
| **The Underclaimer** | Low stance, high status | Possesses recognized expertise but displays epistemic caution or humility. May be strategic (avoiding accountability) or dispositional. | Hedged assertions despite expertise (*"I think it might be…"*), downgraded assessments, deference tokens even in their own domain |
| **The Unknower (K−)** | Low stance, low status | Positions self as lacking knowledge and is recognized as such. The canonical learner, patient, or newcomer. | Interrogatives, B-event statements (*"I hear you're an expert in…"*), rising intonation, request forms |
| **The Calibrator** | Dynamically adjusting stance | Precisely adjusts epistemic claims to context — strong assertions where warranted, hedged claims at boundaries of knowledge, explicit marking of uncertainty gradients. | Graded epistemic markers (*"I'm fairly confident that… but less sure about…"*), source-tagging, conditional syntax |
| **The Epistemic Challenger** | Disrupts others' stance/status alignment | Contests others' right to know — questions credentials, demands evidence, challenges category entitlement. | "How would you know?", "What's your basis for that?", counter-assessments that downgrade the prior speaker's epistemic authority |

## Dimension III: Knowledge Construction Infrastructure

This dimension draws from **ethnomethodology**, **discursive psychology**, and **membership categorization analysis (MCA)** to capture the *methods* people use to make claims appear factual, warranted, or natural [^1].

| Archetype | Infrastructure Strategy | Description | Discursive Devices |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Empiricist** | Factuality through observation | Grounds knowledge claims in direct sensory experience, data, and measurement. Treats observation as the primary warrant. | Sensory evidentials (*"I saw," "the data show"*), quantification, appeal to replicability, objectifying constructions (*"it was found that"*) |
| **The Narrativist** | Factuality through story | Constructs knowledge through coherent narrative — personal experience, case studies, testimony. Truth is established through narrative fidelity and verisimilitude. | Extended narrative sequences, vivid detail as warrant, emotional intensifiers as truth markers, *"Let me tell you what happened"* |
| **The Categorizer** | Factuality through category entitlement | Warrants knowledge by invoking membership in a category that carries epistemic rights — *"As a doctor," "As a mother," "Speaking as someone who lived through it."* | Category-prefaced assertions, stake declarations, appeals to lived experience as non-defeasible warrant [^1] |
| **The Logician** | Factuality through reasoning | Constructs knowledge through deductive or inferential chains. Evidence matters less than the formal structure of the argument. | Conditional syntax (*"If X, then necessarily Y"*), logical connectives, reductio arguments, premise-conclusion structure |
| **The Consensus-Invoker** | Factuality through social agreement | Warrants claims by pointing to shared belief, expert consensus, or common sense. Knowledge is what "everyone knows" or "the field agrees on." | *"It's well established that," "most experts agree," "common sense tells us,"* appeal to majority or tradition |
| **The Stake Manager** | Factuality through inoculation | Anticipates accusations of bias and preemptively manages them. Builds credibility by appearing disinterested or by conceding minor points to win major ones. | *"I have no dog in this fight," "I'll grant you that X, but…,"* displaying reluctance to reach a conclusion (*"I didn't want to believe it, but…"*) |
| **The Deconstructionist** | Anti-factuality / genealogy | Reveals the constructed nature of others' knowledge claims — exposes hidden assumptions, interests, and contingencies. Less interested in building claims than in dismantling them. | *"That's a social construct," "who benefits from that framing?,"* historicizing moves, scare quotes, reflexive questioning of categories |

## Dimension IV: Source & Authority Orientation

This dimension captures **where participants locate epistemic authority** — the ultimate arbiter of what counts as knowledge.

| Archetype | Authority Locus | Description | Discursive Markers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Institutionalist** | Formal institutions (science, law, academia, medicine) | Defers to credentialed expertise and institutional knowledge production. Trusts peer review, professional consensus, and formal epistemologies. | Citation of studies, appeal to credentials, *"the research says," "the court ruled,"* institutional register |
| **The Experientialist** | Lived personal experience | Treats direct experience as the most valid form of knowing. Suspicious of abstractions that contradict what has been felt or witnessed. | First-person narratives, *"I know because I've been there,"* resistance to statistical evidence that contradicts personal observation |
| **The Traditionalist** | Cultural heritage, elders, canonical texts | Locates authority in accumulated wisdom — religious texts, cultural practices, ancestral knowledge, longstanding traditions. | *"It has always been known," "the scriptures say,"* appeals to age, continuity, and precedent |
| **The Crowd-Sourcer** | Distributed collective intelligence | Trusts the aggregation of many perspectives — the "wisdom of crowds," democratic epistemology, or collaborative filtering. | *"Most people think," "the reviews say,"* appeal to ratings, polls, popular opinion, viral consensus |
| **The Autodidact** | Self-directed reasoning | Trusts primarily their own capacity to investigate and reason. May be genuinely rigorous or may use the posture of independent inquiry to reject inconvenient expert consensus. | *"I did my own research," "think for yourself,"* appeals to first principles, skepticism toward all external authority |
| **The Pluralist** | Multiple, triangulated sources | No single source is authoritative; knowledge is best approximated by triangulating across sources, methods, and perspectives. | *"Looking at this from multiple angles," "the evidence converges,"* methodological pluralism, explicit integration of diverse sources |

---

## Dimension V: Sociopolitical Epistemic Orientation

Drawing from **social epistemology**, **epistemic injustice** (Fricker), and **interactional ethnography**, this dimension captures how participants relate to the power dynamics inherent in knowledge production and validation [^1].

| Archetype | Political Orientation to Knowledge | Description | Discursive Markers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Epistemic Egalitarian** | Knowledge access should be democratic | Believes all voices deserve epistemic standing. Actively solicits marginalized perspectives, resists credibility hierarchies. | *"Let's hear from everyone," "whose voice is missing here?,"* turn-allocation to quieter participants, explicit equity framing |
| **The Epistemic Gatekeeper** | Knowledge requires guardianship | Believes that epistemic authority must be earned and that not all claims deserve equal standing. Protects disciplinary boundaries and credentialing norms. | Credentialing challenges (*"Where did you study that?"*), boundary-policing, dismissal of non-credentialed voices, appeals to rigor |
| **The Epistemic Justice Advocate** | Knowledge systems encode oppression | Focuses on **testimonial injustice** (credibility deficits assigned to marginalized speakers) and **hermeneutical injustice** (gaps in collective interpretive resources). Actively works to redistribute epistemic credibility [^1]. | *"That perspective has been systematically silenced," "we lack the concepts to name this experience,"* standpoint epistemology, counter-narrative |
| **The Epistemic Imperialist** | My framework is universal | Assumes one epistemic framework (often the dominant one) applies everywhere. May not recognize this as a position — it feels like "just how things are." | Universalizing claims, erasure of alternative epistemologies, *"that's not real knowledge,"* deficit framing of other traditions |
| **The Epistemic Relativist** | No framework is privileged | Refuses to adjudicate between knowledge systems. Can be a principled stance (respecting incommensurability) or a strategic one (avoiding accountability). | *"That's their way of knowing," "who are we to judge?,"* symmetry arguments, refusal to evaluate |
| **The Epistemic Pragmatist** | Knowledge is for action | Evaluates knowledge claims by their practical consequences and usefulness, not their correspondence to abstract truth. Values what works. | *"Does it actually help?," "the proof is in the results,"* instrumentalist framing, outcome-focused evaluation |

## Composite Archetypes: Epistemic Personalities in Practice

These composites represent recognizable, real-world epistemic orientations that emerge when positions across all five dimensions intersect:

| Composite Archetype | Developmental | Interactional Stance | Construction Method | Authority Source | Sociopolitical |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Scientist** | Evaluativist | Calibrator | Empiricist + stake manager | Institutionalist | Epistemic gatekeeper |
| **The Sage Elder** | Evaluativist | Knower (K+) | Narrativist + categorizer | Traditionalist + experientialist | Epistemic egalitarian |
| **The True Believer** | Dualist | Overclaimer | Consensus-invoker | Traditionalist or institutionalist | Epistemic imperialist |
| **The Critical Theorist** | Meta-epistemologist | Epistemic challenger | Deconstructionist | Pluralist | Epistemic justice advocate |
| **The Internet Researcher** | Often multiplist | Overclaimer | Consensus-invoker (of selected communities) | Autodidact + crowd-sourcer | Epistemic relativist (selectively) |
| **The Practitioner** | Evaluativist | Knower in domain, underclaimer outside | Categorizer (*"As someone who does this daily"*) | Experientialist | Epistemic pragmatist |
| **The Student (Early)** | Dualist → multiplist | Unknower (K−) | Logician (rote) | Institutionalist | Frame-rider (accepts whatever epistemic norms are presented) |
| **The Student (Advanced)** | Multiplist → evaluativist | Calibrator (emerging) | Empiricist + logician | Pluralist (emerging) | Epistemic egalitarian (emerging) |
| **The Witness** | Evaluativist or pre-reflective | Knower (K+) through experience | Narrativist + categorizer (*"As someone who was there"*) | Experientialist | Epistemic justice advocate (for own group) |
| **The Cynic** | Multiplist (hardened) | Epistemic challenger | Deconstructionist | Autodidact | Epistemic relativist |
| **The Diplomat of Knowledge** | Meta-epistemologist | Calibrator | Stake manager + consensus-invoker | Pluralist | Epistemic egalitarian |
| **The Dogmatist** | Dualist | Overclaimer | Categorizer + consensus-invoker | Single-source (varies) | Epistemic imperialist |

## Cross-Dimensional Dynamics

Several important patterns emerge across dimensions:

### Developmental Stage Constrains Other Dimensions

A **Dualist** is unlikely to be a genuine Pluralist in authority orientation or a Deconstructionist in method — the developmental layer acts as a ceiling on epistemic sophistication in other dimensions. Conversely, a **Meta-epistemologist** can *choose* to operate as any other archetype strategically while remaining aware of what they are doing.

### Interactional Stance May Mask Developmental Position

An **Overclaimer** using Dualist language may actually be an Evaluativist performing certainty for rhetorical effect. An **Underclaimer** may be a Knower deploying strategic humility. **IS methodology — close attention to contextualization cues — is essential for distinguishing genuine epistemic positions from performed ones** [^1].

### Power Structures Shape Which Archetypes Are Available

Not all participants can freely occupy all positions. The **Epistemic Gatekeeper** archetype is typically available only to those with institutional power. The **Experientialist** stance is sometimes the only one available to those denied access to institutional credentialing. Epistemic injustice manifests precisely when certain participants are **forced** into the Unknower (K-) position regardless of their actual knowledge [^1].

### Context Triggers Archetype Shifts

The same individual may be a **Scientist** in the lab, a **Sage Elder** at the dinner table, a **Practitioner** in a professional consultation, and a **Cynic** reading the news. Epistemic orientation is always situated, always interactional, always consequential.

## Methodological Applications

This taxonomy is designed to be applied through:

- **Recorded interaction analysis** — identifying epistemic archetypes through hedging patterns, evidential markers, source citations, challenge-response sequences, and the management of epistemic authority
- **Developmental assessment** — mapping where participants fall on the Dualist -> Meta-epistemologist trajectory using extended interviews or reflective writing
- **Institutional analysis** — identifying which archetypes are privileged, silenced, or structurally mandated in particular settings (classrooms, courtrooms, clinical encounters, online platforms)
- **Cross-cultural comparison** — recognizing that the relative prestige and appropriateness of each archetype varies profoundly across epistemic cultures

The fundamental insight from the interactional sociolinguistic tradition holds: **how people relate to knowledge is not a private cognitive trait but a public, interactional, and deeply social accomplishment** [^1].
