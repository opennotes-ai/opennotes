# Training examples for claim relevance check optimization
#
# Format:
#   - example_id: Unique identifier (fp-XXX for false positives, tp-XXX for true positives)
#   - message: The user's original message
#   - fact_check_title: Title of the fact-check article
#   - fact_check_content: Summary content of the fact-check
#   - is_relevant: true if the fact-check is relevant to the message's claim
#   - reasoning: Explanation of why the example is labeled this way
#
# Guidelines for adding examples:
#   - False positives (fp-): Vague mentions, questions, name drops - NOT specific claims
#   - True positives (tp-): Specific, verifiable claims that the fact-check addresses
#   - Maintain balance between TP and FP examples
#   - Each example should teach the model something distinct

  message: "some things about kamala harris"
  fact_check_title: "Did Trump Donate to Kamala Harris' Past Election Campaigns?"
  fact_check_content: "U.S. President Donald Trump donated $6,000 to Kamala Harris'
    2014 campaign for reelection as California attorney general. Records show Trump
    made contributions in 2011 and 2013."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message 'some things about kamala harris' is a vague topic mention
    with no specific claim. It does not assert anything about campaign donations or
    any verifiable fact. The fact-check about Trump's donations is completely unrelated
    to anything stated in the message."

- example_id: fp-002
  message: "how about biden"
  fact_check_title: "Did Biden Say He Would Ban Fracking?"
  fact_check_content: "Joe Biden's position on fracking has been complex. During debates
    he stated he would not ban fracking, though he supports transitioning away from
    fossil fuels."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message 'how about biden' is a question/topic shift with no specific
    claim. It mentions Biden's name but makes no assertion about fracking or any other
    topic that could be fact-checked."

- example_id: fp-003
  message: "or donald trump"
  fact_check_title: "Did Trump Say Injecting Disinfectant Could Treat COVID-19?"
  fact_check_content: "During a White House briefing, Trump suggested research into
    whether disinfectants could be used to treat COVID-19 internally."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message 'or donald trump' is a bare name mention, not a claim. It
    provides no assertion about disinfectants, COVID-19, or any other topic. Cannot
    be fact-checked."

- example_id: fp-004
  message: "What about the vaccine?"
  fact_check_title: "Do COVID-19 Vaccines Contain Microchips?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips are false.
    Vaccines contain mRNA or viral proteins but no tracking devices."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message is a question, not a claim. It asks about 'the vaccine'
    generally but makes no assertion about microchips or any specific claim that could
    be verified."

- example_id: fp-005
  message: "I heard something about immigrants"
  fact_check_title: "Are Immigrants Eating Pets in Springfield, Ohio?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating
    pets have been debunked by local officials and police."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message is a vague reference ('heard something') with no specific
    claim. It doesn't mention pets, Springfield, or Haitian immigrants - topics central
    to the fact-check."

  # Multi-sentence discussion without claim
- example_id: fp-006
  message: "I've been following the news about climate change lately. It's really
    concerning how much debate there is. What do you think about renewable energy?"
  fact_check_title: "Did Scientists Predict an Ice Age in the 1970s?"
  fact_check_content: "While a few studies in the 1970s discussed potential cooling,
    the scientific consensus even then leaned toward warming. The 'ice age prediction'
    claim is largely a myth."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message discusses climate change in general terms and asks for opinions
    about renewable energy. It makes no specific factual claim about ice age predictions
    or any verifiable assertion that the fact-check addresses."

  # Question phrased as wondering/speculation
- example_id: fp-007
  message: "I wonder if there's any truth to what people say about 5G towers"
  fact_check_title: "Do 5G Towers Cause COVID-19?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims linking 5G technology to COVID-19 are false. Viruses
    cannot travel on radio waves, and COVID-19 has spread in countries without 5G
    networks."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message expresses curiosity ('I wonder if') about vague things 'people
    say' regarding 5G towers. It does not assert that 5G causes COVID-19 or any specific
    claim. Wondering about rumors is not making a claim."

  # Hypothetical statement
- example_id: fp-008
  message: "If the election was really stolen, wouldn't there be more evidence by
    now? I'm just trying to understand both sides."
  fact_check_title: "Was the 2020 Election Stolen from Donald Trump?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election have been rejected
    by courts, election officials, and the Department of Justice. Over 60 lawsuits
    were dismissed for lack of evidence."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message poses a hypothetical question ('If the election was really
    stolen') and expresses desire to understand perspectives. It does not assert the
    election was stolen - it's questioning the premise. Hypotheticals and questions
    are not claims."

  # Opinion statement
- example_id: fp-009
  message: "I don't trust pharmaceutical companies. They only care about profits,
    not people's health."
  fact_check_title: "Are COVID-19 Vaccines Unsafe Due to Rushed Development?"
  fact_check_content: "COVID-19 vaccines underwent rigorous testing. The accelerated
    timeline was due to unprecedented funding and parallel (not skipped) trial phases,
    not reduced safety standards."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message expresses distrust and opinion about pharmaceutical company
    motivations. It makes no factual claim about vaccine safety or development timelines.
    Opinions and value judgments are not verifiable claims."

  # Message with URL reference but no claim
- example_id: fp-010
  message: "Did you see this video going around on Twitter? It's about politicians.
    Pretty wild stuff happening these days."
  fact_check_title: "Did Nancy Pelosi Tear Up Her Copy of Trump's State of the Union
    Address?"
  fact_check_content: "Yes, Speaker Nancy Pelosi tore her copy of President Trump's
    State of the Union address on February 4, 2020, immediately after he finished
    speaking."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message references a video vaguely ('about politicians') without
    making any specific claim. It doesn't mention Pelosi, Trump, or the State of the
    Union. Vague references to content are not claims."

  # Comparative/relative statement without factual assertion
- example_id: fp-011
  message: "Politicians these days seem worse than they used to be. Everything is
    so polarized now."
  fact_check_title: "Has Political Polarization in the US Reached Historic Levels?"
  fact_check_content: "Studies show political polarization has increased significantly
    since the 1990s, with partisan antipathy at record highs according to Pew Research
    Center data."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message expresses a subjective impression ('seem worse') and general
    observation about polarization. These are opinions, not specific factual claims.
    'Seem' indicates perception, not assertion of fact."

  # Request for information
- example_id: fp-012
  message: "Can someone explain the whole situation with Hunter Biden's laptop? I
    keep seeing it mentioned but I'm confused about what actually happened."
  fact_check_title: "Was Hunter Biden's Laptop Story Suppressed by Social Media?"
  fact_check_content: "Twitter and Facebook initially limited sharing of the NY Post
    story in October 2020, citing concerns about hacked materials. Twitter later acknowledged
    this was a mistake."
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: "The message is a request for information and admission of confusion.
    The person is not claiming anything about the laptop or social media suppression
    - they're asking others to explain. Requests for clarification are not claims."

  # ========================================
  # TRUE POSITIVES - Specific, verifiable claims
  # ========================================

- example_id: tp-001
  message: "Biden was a Confederate soldier"
  fact_check_title: "Was Joe Biden Ever a Confederate Soldier?"
  fact_check_content: "Joe Biden was born in 1942, decades after the Civil War ended
    in 1865. It is impossible for him to have been a Confederate soldier."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific, verifiable claim: 'Biden was a Confederate
    soldier.' This is a factual assertion that can be checked. The fact-check directly
    addresses this exact claim by examining Biden's birth date vs the Civil War timeline."

- example_id: tp-002
  message: "Trump donated to Kamala Harris's campaign"
  fact_check_title: "Did Trump Donate to Kamala Harris' Past Election Campaigns?"
  fact_check_content: "U.S. President Donald Trump donated $6,000 to Kamala Harris'
    2014 campaign for reelection as California attorney general."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific claim: 'Trump donated to Kamala Harris's
    campaign.' This is a verifiable assertion. The fact-check directly addresses this
    claim and confirms Trump made donations totaling $6,000."

- example_id: tp-003
  message: "The vaccine causes autism"
  fact_check_title: "Do Vaccines Cause Autism?"
  fact_check_content: "Multiple large-scale studies have found no link between vaccines
    and autism. The original study claiming a link was retracted and its author lost
    his medical license."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific causal claim: 'The vaccine causes autism.'
    This is a verifiable factual assertion. The fact-check directly addresses whether
    vaccines cause autism."

- example_id: tp-004
  message: "Haitian immigrants are eating cats and dogs in Ohio"
  fact_check_title: "Are Immigrants Eating Pets in Springfield, Ohio?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating
    pets have been debunked by local officials and police who found no evidence."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets
    in Ohio. The fact-check directly addresses this exact claim about Springfield,
    Ohio."

- example_id: tp-005
  message: "Trump said we should inject bleach to cure COVID"
  fact_check_title: "Did Trump Say Injecting Disinfectant Could Treat COVID-19?"
  fact_check_content: "During a White House briefing, Trump suggested research into
    whether disinfectants could be used internally. He did not use the word 'bleach'
    but referenced disinfectant."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific claim about something Trump said regarding
    injecting substances to treat COVID. The fact-check addresses Trump's comments
    about disinfectants during the briefing."

  # Claim with hedging language
- example_id: tp-006
  message: "Apparently scientists in the 70s all predicted we'd have an ice age by
    now"
  fact_check_title: "Did Scientists Predict an Ice Age in the 1970s?"
  fact_check_content: "While a few studies in the 1970s discussed potential cooling,
    the scientific consensus even then leaned toward warming. The 'ice age prediction'
    claim is largely a myth."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "Despite the hedging word 'apparently', the message makes a specific
    claim: that scientists in the 1970s predicted an ice age. The fact-check directly
    addresses whether this scientific consensus existed. Hedging doesn't negate the
    underlying claim."

  # Claim embedded in longer message
- example_id: tp-007
  message: "I was talking to my uncle at Thanksgiving and he kept insisting that the
    COVID vaccines have killed more people than COVID itself. Is that even possible?"
  fact_check_title: "Have COVID-19 Vaccines Killed More People Than COVID-19?"
  fact_check_content: "This claim is false. COVID-19 has killed over 1 million Americans,
    while vaccine-related deaths reported to VAERS are in the thousands and most are
    unverified coincidental deaths."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message contains a specific embedded claim: 'COVID vaccines have
    killed more people than COVID itself.' Even though it's attributed to someone
    else and followed by a question, the claim is stated. The fact-check directly
    addresses this mortality comparison."

  # Paraphrased/semantically equivalent claim
- example_id: tp-008
  message: "Bill Gates is using vaccines to put tracking chips in everyone"
  fact_check_title: "Do COVID-19 Vaccines Contain Microchips?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips are false.
    Vaccines contain mRNA or viral proteins but no tracking devices. Bill Gates has
    not implanted chips in vaccines."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message claims Gates is using vaccines for tracking via chips. Though
    worded differently than 'vaccines contain microchips', it's semantically equivalent.
    The fact-check addresses both the microchip claim and Gates' involvement."

  # Claim with slight variation from fact-check
- example_id: tp-009
  message: "I read that over 3 million illegal immigrants voted in the 2020 election"
  fact_check_title: "Did Millions of Illegal Immigrants Vote in the 2020 Election?"
  fact_check_content: "Claims of millions of non-citizen votes are false. Multiple
    studies and audits found no evidence of widespread non-citizen voting. Isolated
    cases number in the dozens, not millions."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message makes a specific numerical claim about illegal immigrant
    voting. The '3 million' figure is a variation of the 'millions' claim addressed
    by the fact-check. The core claim about mass non-citizen voting is directly addressed."

  # Strong assertion with emotional language
- example_id: tp-010
  message: "Wake up people! The government admitted chemtrails are real and they're
    spraying us with chemicals!"
  fact_check_title: "Has the Government Admitted to Chemtrails?"
  fact_check_content: "No government has admitted to 'chemtrails.' Contrails are water
    vapor from aircraft engines. Cloud seeding programs exist but are different from
    chemtrail conspiracy claims."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "Despite the emotional framing ('Wake up people!'), the message makes
    specific claims: that the government admitted chemtrails are real and that spraying
    is occurring. The fact-check directly addresses government acknowledgment of chemtrails."

  # Claim presented as established fact
- example_id: tp-011
  message: "Everyone knows that wind turbines cause cancer. Trump even said so."
  fact_check_title: "Do Wind Turbines Cause Cancer?"
  fact_check_content: "There is no scientific evidence that wind turbines cause cancer.
    Trump made this claim in 2019, but health organizations worldwide have found no
    causal link between wind turbines and cancer."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "The message asserts as fact that wind turbines cause cancer and attributes
    confirmation to Trump. Both are verifiable claims. The fact-check addresses whether
    wind turbines cause cancer and Trump's statement."

  # Recent/timely claim
- example_id: tp-012
  message: "Did you hear? They found proof that the moon landing was faked"
  fact_check_title: "Was the Apollo 11 Moon Landing Faked?"
  fact_check_content: "The Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 was real. Evidence includes
    moon rocks, retroreflectors still used today, and independent verification from
    multiple countries including the Soviet Union."
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: "Although phrased as a question, 'Did you hear? They found proof that
    X' is a common way to assert a claim. The message claims proof was found that
    the moon landing was faked. The fact-check addresses moon landing authenticity."
- example_id: fp-013
  message: what about the 2020 election?
  fact_check_title: 'Fact-check: No evidence that widespread fraud changed the outcome
    of the 2020 U.S. presidential election'
  fact_check_content: Multiple courts, state audits, and recounts found no
    credible evidence of widespread fraud that would have altered the result;
    specific allegations about Dominion voting machines and large numbers of
    ineligible ballots have been investigated and debunked.
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: The user's message is a vague prompt asking about the 2020 election
    and does not make a specific, verifiable claim. The fact-check addresses
    particular allegations about fraud and voting machines, so although
    topically related, it does not directly respond to any explicit claim in the
    user's brief question.
- example_id: fp-014
  message: what about Biden and vaccines?
  fact_check_title: No evidence COVID-19 vaccines include microchips or are
    being used to track people
  fact_check_content: Several fact-checkers examined claims that COVID-19
    vaccines contain microchips or are being used to surveil recipients and
    found no credible evidence to support those allegations, citing vaccine
    manufacturing processes and statements from public health agencies. The
    article explains how the rumor originated and why it is scientifically
    impossible based on vaccine composition.
  is_relevant: false
  reasoning: The user message is a vague question mentioning 'Biden and
    vaccines' rather than asserting a specific verifiable claim that the
    fact-check addresses. Because it does not claim that Biden did something
    specific (for example, ordering microchip implants), the fact-check about
    microchips is not directly relevant to this open-ended query. A relevant
    match would require the user to state or ask about the particular false
    claim.
- example_id: tp-013
  message: The COVID mRNA vaccines alter your DNA and can permanently change
    your genes.
  fact_check_title: No — mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not alter or integrate into
    your DNA
  fact_check_content: Scientists explain that mRNA vaccines deliver messenger
    RNA to the cell cytoplasm and do not enter the nucleus where DNA resides;
    the mRNA is transient and cannot integrate into human genomic DNA, so the
    vaccines cannot permanently change genes.
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: The user's message makes a specific, verifiable claim that mRNA
    COVID-19 vaccines alter DNA and permanently change genes. The fact-check
    directly addresses the biological mechanism and refutes that claim, so it is
    relevant.
- example_id: tp-014
  message: Is it true that the COVID mRNA vaccines alter your DNA and integrate
    into your genome?
  fact_check_title: No — COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter or integrate into
    human DNA
  fact_check_content: Researchers and health agencies explain that mRNA vaccines
    deliver temporary instructions to produce a viral protein in the cell
    cytoplasm, do not enter the cell nucleus where DNA resides, and are rapidly
    degraded; there is no biological mechanism or evidence that they integrate
    into human genomes.
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: The user's message makes a specific, verifiable claim that mRNA
    vaccines alter human DNA and integrate into the genome. The fact-check
    directly addresses this precise claim by explaining the biological
    mechanisms and evidence showing mRNA vaccines do not alter or integrate with
    DNA, so it is clearly relevant.
- example_id: tp-015
  message: I heard the COVID-19 vaccines make women infertile — is that true?
  fact_check_title: No evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility, health
    experts say
  fact_check_content: Health agencies and multiple peer-reviewed studies have
    found no link between COVID-19 vaccination and infertility; the viral claim
    rests on flawed comparisons and has been debunked by reproductive
    specialists.
  is_relevant: true
  reasoning: The user makes a specific, verifiable claim that COVID-19 vaccines
    cause infertility. The fact-check directly addresses and refutes that same
    claim with evidence and expert statements, so it is relevant.
