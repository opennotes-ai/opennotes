# Training examples for claim relevance check optimization
#
# Format:
#   - example_id: Unique identifier (fp-XXX for false positives, tp-XXX for true positives)
#   - message: The user's original message
#   - fact_check_title: Title of the fact-check article
#   - fact_check_content: Summary content of the fact-check
#   - is_relevant: true if the fact-check is relevant to the message's claim
#   - reasoning: Explanation of why the example is labeled this way
#
# Guidelines for adding examples:
#   - False positives (fp-): Vague mentions, questions, name drops - NOT specific claims
#   - True positives (tp-): Specific, verifiable claims that the fact-check addresses
#   - Maintain balance between TP and FP examples
#   - Each example should teach the model something distinct

examples:

  # FALSE POSITIVES - Vague mentions, not claims
