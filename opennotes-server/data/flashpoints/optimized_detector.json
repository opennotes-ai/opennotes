        "reasoning": "The reply is a calm, factual follow-up question challenging an assertion (\"They have not built boats...\"). It requests evidence or reasoning about future behavior but contains no insults, threats, or emotionally charged language. This makes it a normal, potentially productive debate rather than a provocation likely to cause conflict. While any disagreement can escalate, the immediate tone and content indicate a low likelihood of derailing into hostility.",

I work in a field where moving up is notoriously difficult because people just never retire and there aren't new boats being made, so like, if a captain doesn't leave, there's never going to be a new opening.   \n\n\nShould we hire people with less experience with boats to be captains?   \n\n\nHow about teachers? Should we just get rid of tenure and replace all the teachers with less experienced folks?   \n\n\nWhat field is that actually beneficial in?\nSwimreadmed: I'm not speaking about them being paid, I'm talking about them being unaffected by their own decisions other than on long cycles, someone who wields power while being financially unaffected by their decisions on other people's finances, are essentially undemocratic. There needs to be a system that forces their wages to be reflective of their own success, this is a capitalist society, people don't get paid to flop.\nLittlepush: The whole point of a democratic government is to check capitalism and enforce morality. If whatever makes the most money is always best there's no need for government to step in.\nSwimreadmed: I didn't equate success with money, I don't expect the senator of California to make less personally than the senator of Kansas, since Cali makes more money, that's why I said relative to their states' laws and incomes\nLittlepush: So? Selling child pornography makes money, murdering people once they get to old to work makes money, fracking apart ever last mountain makes money, why shouldn't voters get to decide which of these is worth getting money for?",

One participant’s terse rebuttal (\"?????? They did... it's illegal other than fracking which is being debated upon.\") signals confusion/ frustration and the thread already includes provocative examples likely to elicit strong emotional responses. There are no direct threats or targeted harassment yet, but the subject matter and tone make escalation into a heated argument likely.",

I'm not saying that a new tax should be implemented if one already exists (as is the case in many places), I'm saying that disposable feminine hygiene products should be taxed, and that tax should go towards funding/subsidizing reusable alternatives.",
        "reasoning": "Both participants are civil and engaged in clarification, with no insults or aggressive language. The topic (taxation of feminine hygiene products) can be politically or emotionally charged, so there's a moderate chance a broader or prolonged discussion could become contentious if others with strong opposing views join.

Your job is to assess how likely a given conversation (and the specific “message” being evaluated) is to derail into interpersonal conflict.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\nYou will receive:\n- context: prior turns in the thread/conversation (may include multiple speakers and quotes)\n- message: the new utterance to evaluate in that context\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (always)\nReturn a JSON object with exactly these keys:\n- reasoning: 3–6 sentences explaining the risk assessment using concrete cues from the text\n- risk_level: one label from the Risk Scale below\n\nRISK SCALE (ordered, increasing)\n1) Calm — cooperative/neutral, disagreement handled politely; focused on ideas.\n2) Guarded — some tension or sensitive content; mild friction or “yellow flags,” but still mostly constructive.\n3) Heated — clear escalation signals (confrontational tone, rhetorical jabs, identity-laden topic, repeated disagreement, sarcasm, mockery, or loaded framing) where replies are likely to become an argument.\n4) Hostile — direct personal attacks/insults, contempt, accusations of bad faith, dehumanizing language, threats, or dogpiling; high likelihood of flamewar.\n\nCORE TASK: “DERAILING INTO CONFLICT” DETECTION\nYou are not judging who is correct. You are predicting whether the exchange is likely to shift from substantive discussion into personal conflict.\n\nPay special attention to the distinction between:\n- Constructive disagreement: asks clarifying questions, cites sources, acknowledges uncertainty, uses “I” statements, critiques ideas not people.\n- Derailing dynamics: labels the other person (“you obviously don’t understand”), questions competence/motives (“do you know better than…”), moralizes/psychoanalyzes (“concerning,” “extreme”), uses ridicule/sarcasm, introduces inflammatory analogies (e.g., sexuality comparisons), or repeatedly reframes in a way that implies bad faith (“technicality,” “trying to get away with…”).\n\nHEURISTICS / SIGNALS (use multiple; don’t rely on topic alone)\nEscalation cues (raise risk):\n- Direct second-person attacks or dismissals: “you obviously…”, “what even?”, “are you serious?”\n- Rhetorical dominance challenges: “Do you know better than the entire medical establishment?”\n- Sensitive/polarizing domains: religion/existence, sexuality, gender dysphoria in minors, colonialism/identity history—especially when paired with accusatory tone.\n- Crude/profane emphasis that increases heat (not automatically hostile, but can raise temperature).\n- Bad-faith accusations, contempt, or repeated “gotcha” framing.\n- Prior context already contains friction; the new message adds pressure rather than de-escalating.\n\nDe-escalation cues (lower risk):\n- Genuine questions seeking understanding (not rhetorical traps)\n- Softening language (“I might be wrong…”, “help me understand…”)\n- Explicit respect/charitability\n- Evidence-based framing without credential-shaming\n\nLABEL SELECTION RULES (to avoid ties/overlap)\n- Use Hostile if there is a direct personal insult/dismissal or explicit contempt aimed at a participant (even if only one sentence).\n  Example pattern: “You obviously don’t understand X.” => Hostile.\n- Use Heated if the message is confrontational or identity/authority-challenging but stops short of direct insult (credential-shaming, “common sense” dismissals, provocative analogies).\n- Use Guarded when the topic is emotionally charged and there are mild judgments (“extreme,” “concerning”) but the exchange remains mostly civil and idea-focused.\n- Use Calm when disagreement remains polite/analytic with minimal emotional charge.\n\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS\n- Cite 2–4 specific textual cues (phrases/tone/moves) from context/message that justify the level.\n- Mention whether the message escalates, maintains, or de-escalates the prior tone.\n- Do not add extra keys, scores, or probabilities—only the required JSON fields.",
